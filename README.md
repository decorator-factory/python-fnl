# FNL
## FNL is Not Lisp

FNL is a terse and extensible markup language for your blog.

HTML documentation is available at `fnl/docs/html/`. It's compiled from FNL files!

You can view the documentation at https://decorator-factory.github.io/python-fnl/

# Building the docs

To build the docs, first install `fnl`, then run the `docs` module:

```sh
$ python -m fnl.docs
```

# VSCode syntax highlighting

Copy the `fnl-syntax-highlighting` to your `.vscode` (e.g. `~/.vscode`) folder
and reload VSCode. You may need to connect the suffix (`.fnl`) to the language
(_FNL is Not Lisp_).
