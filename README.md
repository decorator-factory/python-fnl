# FNL
## FNL is Not Lisp

FNL is a terse and extensible markup language for your blog.

HTML documentation is available at `fnl/docs/html/`. It's compiled from FNL files!

You can view the documentation at https://decorator-factory.github.io/python-fnl/

# Building the docs

To build the docs, first install `fnl`, then run the `docs` module:

```sh
$ python -m fnl.docs
```
